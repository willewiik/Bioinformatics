# Question 1

We consider a gene locus with two possible alleles (say $A$ and $a$) and a diploid population with
$N$ individuals. Hence, there are 2$N$ alleles in the population. Let $p$ be the proportion of $A$s in
the allele population and $q$ the population of as (of course $p$ + $q$ = 1). A population is said to
be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium if the proportion of $AA$ homozygotes is $p^2$, aa homozygotes
is $q^2$ and the proportion of heterozygotes ($Aa$) is $2pq$.


<!-- alleles = gener -->
<!-- mating = parning -->


## Question 1.1

Show that with random mating (i.e. both alleles of the o spring are just randomly, with proportions $p$ and $q$, drawn from the parental allele population) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is attained
in the first generation. What is the proportion of $A$ and $a$ alleles in the offspring population?
Hence, with random mating, can a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ever deviate from
it?

If the mating is random then all individuals inherits alleles indepnedently with probabilities $p$ and $q$ from
each parent. Then:

$$P(AA) = p\cdot p =p^2$$
$$P(aa) = q\cdot q= q^2$$
$$P(Aa) = (p \cdot q) + (p \cdot q) = 2pq$$

<!-- ?? -->

The population can not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium unless factors such as mutation changes the alleles.

## Question 1.2

We look at the MN blood group, it
has two possible codominating (both contribute to heterozygotes) alleles $L^M$ (denoted $M$) and
$L^N$ (denoted $N$). In a population of 1000 Americans of Caucasian descent the following genotype
counts were observed, 357 individuals were $MM$, 485 were $MN$ and 158 were $NN$. Use a chisquare goodness of t test to test if the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.


```{r}

MM <- 357
MN <- 485
NN <- 158

population <- 1000

# p = the proportion of Ms in the allele population 
p <- (2 * MM + MN) / (2 * population)
q <- 1 - p

# Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
HW_MM <- p**2  * population
HW_NN <- q**2  * population
HW_MN <- q * p  * population * 2


# chisq = sum[(Observed - Expected)^2 / (Expected)]
##pchisq()


```
